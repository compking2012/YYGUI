# Porsche.js

Porsche is an amazing app framework which enables you to build an app using JavaScript with high-performance user interface easily. Meanwhile, similar as React, Porsche is independent to the runtime. That means you can - learn once, write anywhere. 

Porsche, currently, will grow up as 2 branches: Porsche.js and Porsche Native. Porsche.js is completely running on HTML5-enabled web browser environment. It is actually based on HTML5 canvas to render the entire user interface and interact with user input. You can use it on the browser of desktop, mobile, pad, or TV box. Porsche Native is mostly compatible to Porsche.js with the same UI view system, programming model and API design. However, Porsche Native runs on a special JS runtime (virtual machine).
